# Introduction

Originally a fork from [Sourabh Bajaj](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/), this quick guide was initially re-written with the intent of setting up a developer environment for product designers at [Abstract](https://abstract.ph/). Now, we're sharing it to the world to help super-charge other design teams, and for everyone who loves to ship digital products! ðŸš€

If you feel that:

* Your mac ran slower with each OS update & decided to do a clean install
* Decided to live a minimalist life and does a futile attempt of decluttering his/her mac
* Orrr.. you bought a brand new macbook! \(Congratulations!\)

Then this guide might be for you. 

Feel free to use this guide â€“ share it or fork it. No need to strictly follow it. This guide is designed to our current workflow and tech stack in the company, so please do feel free to augment it according to your needs. ðŸ¦„âœ¨
