# Introduction

Originally a fork from [Sourabh Bajaj](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/), this quick guide was initially re-written with the intent of setting up a UI development environment for product designers at [Abstract Digital](https://abstract.ph/). Now, we're sharing it to the world to help super-charge other design teams, and for everyone who loves to ship digital products! ðŸš€

If you feel that:

* You want to have a consistent dev environment for your design team âš¡
* You're a designer who needs easy instructions in setting up dev stuff in your machine ðŸ’»
* You're a designer who wants to flex how cool your terminal looks like ðŸ’ª

Then this guide might be for you.
