# Introduction

Originally a fork from [Sourabh Bajaj](http://sourabhbajaj.com/mac-setup/), this quick guide was written with the intent of onboarding every designers' mac at Symph. Now, we're sharing it to the world who is curious about it, and for everyone who wants to design digital products. \(Oh yeah, open-source ftw!\)

If you feel that:

* Your mac ran slower with each OS update & decided to do a clean installation
* Decided to live a minimalist life and does a futile attempt of decluttering his/her mac
* You need to be aligned with the tools you use in the team
* Or You bought a brand new macbook, congratulations!

Then this guide might be for you.

Feel free to use this guide, share it or modify it. No need to strictly follow it if you know what you're doing. This guide is designed to our current workflow and tech stack in the company, so please do feel free to augment it according to your needs.
