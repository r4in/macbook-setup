  development. *Updated for MacOS Sonoma*

# Introduction

This quick guide was initially created to set up a UI development environment for product designers, a setup previously adopted at [Symph](https://www.symph.co/) and [Abstract Digital](https://abstract.ph/). Now, Iâ€™m sharing it with the world to help supercharge other design teams and for everyone who loves shipping digital products! ðŸš€

If you feel that:

* You want a consistent dev environment for your design team âš¡
* Youâ€™re a designer who needs easy instructions for setting up dev tools on your machine ðŸ’»
* Youâ€™re a designer who wants to show off how cool your terminal looks ðŸ’ª&#x20;

Then this guide might be for you.&#x20;
