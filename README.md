# Introduction

This quick guide was initially written with the intent of setting up a UI development environment for product designers which was previously adopted at [Symph](https://www.symph.co) and [Abstract Digital](https://abstract.ph/). Now, I'm sharing it to the world to help super-charge other design teams, and for everyone who loves to ship digital products! 🚀

If you feel that:

* You want to have a consistent dev environment for your design team ⚡
* You're a designer who needs easy instructions in setting up dev stuff in your machine 💻
* You're a designer who wants to flex how cool your terminal looks like 💪

Then this guide might be for you.&#x20;
