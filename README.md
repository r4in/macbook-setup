# For Product Designers, By Product Designers

This is a quick guide I wrote for the modern product designer in Symph and for those who has decided to reinstall OSX for the following reasons:

* Mac ran slower and slower \(and slower\) with each OS update
* Decided to live a minimalist life and does a futile attempt of decluttering his/her mac
* Onboarded someone new to the team or
* You bought a brand new macbook, congratulations!

Feel free to use this guide, share it or modify it. No need to strictly follow it if you know what you're doing. This guide is designed to our current workflow and tech stack in the company, so please do feel free to augment it to your needs.
