# Installing macOS

## Fresh Install, Is Best Install

I usually prefer wiping out my whole hard drive and just doing a fresh install. I've done macOS upgrades in the past but I still feel the bloat after two continuous OS upgrades. So let's create a bootable macOS installer!

First, download the latest macOS via App Store:

## Creating A Bootable Installer

There are numerous apps and ways to create a bootable macOS install. As of this writing, [Disk Maker X](https://diskmakerx.com) no longer supports Big Sur. But you can still easily do this on your Terminal. Here's how you create a bootable thumb drive:

* Prepare a 16GB usb thumb drive that's ready to be wiped out
* Make sure you already have downloaded macOS Big Sur. After downloading, It should be sitting on your Applications folder like this:

![You can find it under Applications > Install macOS Monterey](<../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2022-01-02 at 10.00.20 PM.png>)

* Insert your thumbdrive and simply run this command below on your terminal. Make sure you replace "**Untitled"** with the name of your usb thumb drive.

```
sudo '/Applications/Install macOS Monterey.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia' --volume '/Volumes/Untitled'
```

* Wait for around 10-15 minutes to complete. You should see this after completing it:

## Backup Checklist

* [ ] Files on the **Desktop** folder
* [ ] Files on the **Downloads** folder
* [ ] Files on the **Documents** folder\
  I recommend Google Docs/Sheets
* [ ] Files on the **Pictures** folder \
  I recommend Google Photos
* [ ] Your **Git** folder\
  I recommend Github or Bitbucket
* [ ] Quick code snippets / links / random texts \
  Instead of saving them on icloud notes or on sublime text/note taking apps - use [Paste](https://pasteapp.me)!&#x20;
* [ ] Browser bookmarks, settings, history, ect.  \
  If you're using different browsers, [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io) is a great bookmarks manager.
* [ ] Passwords, Server logins, sensitive-stuff. \
  (Don't store them in your notes. Use password generators like [1Password](https://1password.com). I recommend [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com))
* [ ] Don't forget to backup your public ssh keys too
* [ ] Your saved typefaces

## Cloud Storage

Before, I used to back everything up to an external hard drive. Now, I sync all my files to the cloud. [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com) is great (And right-clicking to share public links works like a charm). But I'm seeing [Google One ](https://one.google.com)as a more economically viable option. And if you're living on an Apple ecosystem, [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/ph/icloud/) might make sense for you.&#x20;

## Let The Purge Begin

Now it's time to take a deep breath, shutdown your machine, and hope there won't be regrets. üêµ

**Warning** There's no going back after this point, so be sure to backup your files to the cloud. And if you don't feel comfortable with it, just do a manual backup using your external hard drive.
{% endhint %}

Insert the bootable USB and upon pressing the power key, **hold the option key** until it loads up a screen which prompts you to choose which device you want to boot from. So select the thumb drive with the macOS installer.

Select **Disk Utility** and click **Continue**.&#x20;

Currently what you see here are the drive partitions. What we want to do is to wipe up the whole hard drive. Select **View** > **Show All Devices**

Then select the physical storage device you want to erase (ex. _APPLE SSD AP0512J Media_), then click **Erase**

Select **GUID Partition Map** and **Apple File System (APFS)** for the file system format. Then enter a name.

After that, go back and click on Reinstall OS X.

The process is pretty much straightforward into a series of clicking **next**.
