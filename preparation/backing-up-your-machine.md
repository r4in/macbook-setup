# Installing macOS

## Fresh Install, Is Best Install

I usually prefer wiping out my whole hard drive and just doing a fresh install. I've done macOS upgrades in the past but I still feel the bloat after two continuous OS upgrades. So let's create a bootable macOS installer!

First, download the latest macOS via App Store:

## Creating A Bootable Installer

There are numerous apps and ways to create a bootable macOS install. As of this writing, [Disk Maker X](https://diskmakerx.com/) no longer supports Big Sur. But you can still easily do this on your Terminal. Here's how you create a bootable thumb drive:

* Prepare a 16GB usb thumb drive that's ready to be wiped out
* Make sure you already have downloaded macOS Big Sur. After downloading, It should be sitting on your Applications folder like this:

* Insert your thumbdrive and simply run this command below on your terminal. Make sure you replace "**Untitled"** with the name of your usb thumb drive.

```text
sudo '/Applications/Install macOS Big Sur.app/Contents/Resources/createinstallmedia' --volume '/Volumes/Untitled'
```

* Wait for around 10-15 minutes to complete. You should see this after completing it:

## Backup Checklist

* [ ] Files on the **Downloads** folder
* [ ] Files on the **Desktop** folder
* [ ] Files on the **Documents** folder I recommend Google Docs/Sheets
* [ ] Files on the **Pictures** folder  I recommend Google Photos
* [ ] Your **Git** folder I recommend Github or Bitbucket
* [ ] Quick code snippets / links / random texts  Instead of saving them on icloud notes or on sublime text/note taking apps - use [Paste](https://pasteapp.me/)! 
* [ ] Browser bookmarks, settings, history, ect.   If you're using different browsers, [Raindrop.io](https://raindrop.io/) is a great bookmarks manager.
* [ ] Passwords, Server logins, sensitive-stuff.  \(Don't store them in your notes. Use password generators like [1Password](https://1password.com/). I recommend [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)\)
* [ ] Don't forget to backup your public ssh keys too
* [ ] Your saved typefaces

## Cloud Storage

Before, I used to back everything up to an external hard drive. Now, I sync all my files to the cloud. [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) is great \(And right-clicking to share public links works like a charm\). But I'm seeing [Google One ](https://one.google.com/)as a more economically viable option. And if you're living on an Apple ecosystem, [iCloud](https://www.apple.com/ph/icloud/) might make sense for you.

{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Warning** There's no going back after this point, so be sure to backup your files to the cloud. And if you don't feel comfortable with it, just do a manual backup using your external hard drive.
{% endhint %}

## Let The Purge Begin

Now it's time to take a deep breath, shutdown your machine, and hope there won't be regrets. üêµ

Insert the bootable USB and upon pressing the power key, **hold the option key** until it loads up a screen which prompts you to choose which device you want to boot from. So select the thumb drive with the macOS installer.

Select **Disk Utility** and click **Continue**.

Next thing you wanna do is clear out your hard drive by clicking on the your Internal SSD Drive \(_APPLE SSD SM05_.. in this example\) and hitting Erase. This will reformat your drive. Choose **Apple File System \(APFS\).** After that, go back and click on Reinstall OS X.

{% hint style="warning" %}
There's are reported issues with macOS Catalina where it does fully erase the whole drive. If that happens, follows these steps below. \(Thanks for the heads up [@jermaineldilao](https://jermainedilao.github.io/)\)

* open Disk Utility
* go to view menu and check the "show All Devices"
* You will see some options \(Macintosh HD\) on Container-disk1 and one of them is unmounted \(Macintosh HD - Data\). select that one and mount it.
* finally restart your Mac
{% endhint %}

After that, the process is pretty much straightforward into a series of clicking next.
