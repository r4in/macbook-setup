# Preparing Your Mac

## Cleaning Up The Dust

Within a year, your machine will start to accumulate a lot of dust. When this happens - your fans will have to work harder to dissipate heat. And when your CPU gets too hot, your machine throttle downs CPU performance. \(If you see `kernal_task` eating up 80-90% on your processes, it's definitely happening\)

![You can see kernal\_task running at 2.8%. I&apos;m using iStats for realtime status reports](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

You can have it cleaned over at your local iStore, which probably costs around Php800 \(Around $16\) or you can do it yourself if you have the tools.

## Thermal Paste Replacement

If your mac has been around for more then 3-4 years, maybe its time to reconsider on adding a fresh thermal paste for your CPU and GPU. Any thermal paste will do, however a low quality one wont last too long. I used **Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut** Thermal Paste a noticed a 10 degree drop from my previous thermal paste.

### **My tools:**
