## Z

Z is actually not part of Zsh, but its a really cool way to jump to frecent folders. It makes navigating through the file system a breeze.

To install:

`$ brew install z`

And remember to add to your .zshrc \(if you're using zsh\) or .bashprofile \(if you're using bash\)

`$ brew info z`

Also, don't forget to add this to your .zshrc file

```
# include Z
. /usr/local/etc/profile.d/z.sh
```
