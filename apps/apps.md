# Intro

Oh, hello there! Here contains some of the apps and tools we use on a daily basis. Apps we love are are marked with a [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/#:~:text=The%20trophy%20emoji%20is%20a,to%20Emoji%201.0%20in%202015.) emoji in its category. You don't need to install everything. Take what you need and experiment what best works for you. 

## Installation

As much as possible, I do try to install everything using Homebrew because I find updating and managing these apps faster on the terminal.

```text
brew cask install <app-name>
```

However, not everything is available on the caskroom, such as Adobe Creative Cloud \(Photoshop, Illustrator, ect\), so there will be a few exceptions of course. Which is why some of the apps will be install via mas \(Mac AppStore\) command-line

## Pro Tip

So I usually turn-off automatic updates for everything by default. That's to prevent updates popping in when I'm in the middle of work. Usually at every end of the week - that's when I run OS updates and app updates. With Homebrew upgrading everything is as easy as typing in this command:

```text
brew cu --all
```

Then sit back, relax and enjoy the show üòé
