# Intro

Oh, hello there! Here are some of the apps and tools we use on a daily basis. Apps we love are marked with a [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/) emoji in their category. You don't need to install everything. Take what you need and experiment with what works for you.&#x20;

## Installation

As much as possible, I try to install everything using Homebrew because I find updating and managing these apps faster on the terminal.

```
brew install --cask <app-name>
```

However, not everything is available on the caskroom, such as Adobe Creative Cloud (Photoshop, Illustrator, etc.), so there will be a few exceptions of course. This is why some of the apps will be installed via **mas** (Mac AppStore) command line.

## Pro Tip

So I usually turn off automatic updates for everything by default. That's to prevent updates from popping in when I'm in the middle of work. Usually at the end of the week - that's when I run OS updates and app updates. With Homebrew upgrading everything is as easy as typing in this command:

```
brew cu --all
```

Then sit back, relax, and enjoy the show üòé
