# Intro

## Installation

As much as possible, I do try to install everything using Homebrew because I find updating and managing these apps faster on the terminal.

```text
brew cask install <app-name>
```

However, not everything is available on the caskroom, such as Adobe Creative Cloud \(Photoshop, Illustrator, ect\), so there will be a few exceptions of course.

## Pro Tip

So I usually turn-off automatic updates for everything by default. That's to prevent updates popping in when I'm in the middle of work. Usually at every end of the week - that's when I run OS updates and app updates. With Homebrew upgrading everything is as easy as typing in this command:

```text
brew cu --all
```

Then sit back, relax and enjoy the show ðŸ˜Ž
