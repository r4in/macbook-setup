# Developer Tools

Most of the development tools found here are geared toward frontend development, static site generations and CMS.

### **Terminal**

**iTerm**\
Your terminal on steroids

```
brew install --cask iterm2
```

**Hyper**  [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)\
A terminal built on web technologies.

```
brew install --cask hyper
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Since our move to VS Code from Sublime, alot of people are using the built-in terminal window in it. Depending on your setup - it's up to you if you feel like running lots of different processes on different terminal windows.

### **IRC &** Instant Messaging

**Limechat**\
It's the IRC for geeks

{% embed url="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/limechat/id414030210?mt=12" %}

If you already have previously installed it, you can run&#x20;

```
mas install 414030210
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When googling errors on Stackoverflow fails,  I use mostly Limechat for asking  questions when I want instantaneous answers in language-specific channels (#css, #wordpress, #js) at [Freenode](https://freenode.net/)
{% endhint %}

**Gitter**\
Chat tool for communities

```
brew install --cask gitter
```

**Spectrum**\

brew  install --cask spectrum
```

### **Local Server Environments**

**MAMP**\
Apache + mySQL + PHP stack (for Wordpress development)

```
brew install --cask mamp
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to build Wordpress sites, MAMP does a good job of running a local server for your Wordpress site to run.
{% endhint %}

### Code Snippets Manager

**Quiver**\
The Programmer's Notebook

```
https://happenapps.com/downloads/QuiverFreeTrial.zip
```

{% hint style="info" %}
I was always looking for a great way to store quick code snippets I could access anytime because I find it really annoying opening old projects because of a code snippet that I find reusable. **Quiver** was a good contender for it being lightweight, fast, and it having good code-formatting. Shared notebooks allows you to sync-in code snippet collaboratively. Only downside would probably it's $10 price tag and the iOS app is read-only.

**Lepton** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)\
The Lean Github Gist Client

```
brew install --cask lepton
```

{% hint style="info" %}
I'm starting to move to this one because first of all - the gists syncs up on github (which is great for sharing) and it's completely FREE.
{% endhint %}

### **Database Management**

**Sequel Pro** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)\
A nice database tool

```
brew install --cask sequel-pro
```

{% hint style="info" %}
There are times when I want to modify the database tables easily in a GUI (Command-line is cool and geeky, but sometimes - I'm just in a hurry)
{% endhint %}

### **FTP Clients**

**Transmit** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)\
Simply the best FTP client, it has a price tag tho

```
brew install --cask transmit
```

**Filezilla** \
It works, gets the job done and most of all - it's FREE!

```
brew install --cask filezilla
```
