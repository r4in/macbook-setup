# Developer Tools

Most of the development tools found here are geared toward frontend development, static site generations and CMS.

### **Terminal**

**iTerm** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)  
Your terminal on steroids

```text
brew cask install iterm2
```

**Hyper**  
A terminal built on web technologies.

```text
https://hyper.is/
```



{% hint style="info" %}
Since our move to VS Code from Sublime, alot of people are using the built-in terminal window in it. Depending on your setup - it's up to you if you feel like running lots of different processes on different terminal windows.

### **IRC,** Instant Messaging and Chat

**Limechat**  
It's the IRC for geeks

```text
http://limechat.net/mac/
```

{% hint style="info" %}
When googling errors on Stackoverflow fails,  I use mostly Limechat for asking  questions when I want instantaneous answers in language-specific channels \(\#css, \#wordpress, \#js\) at [Freenode](https://freenode.net/)
{% endhint %}

**Gitter**  
Chat tool

```text
brew cask install gitter
```

### **Local Server Environments**

**MAMP**  
Apache + mySQL + PHP stack \(for Wordpress development\)

```text
brew cask install mamp
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to build Wordpress sites, MAMP does a good job of running a local server for your Wordpress site to run.
{% endhint %}

### Code Snippets Manager

**Quiver**  
The Programmer's Notebook

```text
https://happenapps.com/downloads/QuiverFreeTrial.zip
```

{% hint style="info" %}
I was always looking for a great way to store quick code snippets I could access anytime because I find it really annoying opening old projects because of a code snippet that I find reusable. **Quiver** was a good contender for it being lightweight, fast, and it having good code-formatting. Shared notebooks allows you to sync-in code snippet collaboratively. Only downside would probably it's $10 price tag and the iOS app is read-only.

**Lepton** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)  
The Lean Github Gist Client

```text
brew cask install lepton
```

{% hint style="info" %}
I'm starting to move to this one because first of all - the gists syncs up on github \(which is great for sharing\) and it's completely FREE.
{% endhint %}

### **Database Management**

**Sequel Pro** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)  
A nice database tool

```text
brew cask install sequel-pro
```

{% hint style="info" %}
There are times when I want to modify the database tables easily in a GUI \(Command-line is cool and geeky, but sometimes - I'm just in a hurry\)
{% endhint %}

**Transmit** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)  
Simply the best FTP client, it has a price tag tho

It works, gets the job done and most of all - it's FREE!

```text
brew cask install filezilla
