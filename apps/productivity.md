My favorite window manager

```
brew install --cask rectangle

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Why Rectangle?" %}
Mainly because I'm super familiar with Spectacle before and it follows the same shortcuts such as:

* `cmd + option + arrow key` to cycle thru 1/2 and 1/3 to the direction you want it auto-arrange
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Settings" %}
Some shortcuts that I don't normally use conflict with the other apps that I frequently use (like Figma's copy merged)

*   Go to **Preference** and disable the shortcuts for:

    * Top Left
    * Top Right
    * Bottom Left
    * Bottom Right
    * Maximize
    * Almost Maximize
    * Maximize Height
    * Make Smaller
    * Make Larger
    * Center
    * Restore


* Check **Launch on login**
* Check **Hide menu bar icon**
* Set **Repeated commands -> cycle 1/2, 2/3 and 1/3 on half actions**
* Set **Gaps between windows -> 8px**
