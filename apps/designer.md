# Design Tools

### **UI Design Tools**

**Sketch**  
My ex-digital design tool

```text
brew cask install sketch
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Sketch is an amazing tool I used from 2016 to 2018. Then I switched to Figma due to the remote and collaborative nature of my work setup. One thing that I initially missed on Sketch was the power of plugins, however - Figma was able to catch up with that this year.
{% endhint %}

**Invision Studio**  
The upcoming design, prototyping and animation tool.

```text
brew cask install invision
```

{% hint style="info" %}
This tool has super promising features but a year later - it still hasn't really took off. I used it once for a project, however one thing I liked about it is the ease of using when prototyping with simple transitions & animations.
{% endhint %}

**Figma** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)  
My current favourite collaborative UI design tool \(for now\).

```text
brew cask install figma
```

**Adobe Creative Cloud**  

What I usually need are just:

* Adobe Photoshop CC 2020
* Adobe Illustrator CC 2020

Download the [Adobe Creative Cloud](https://www.adobe.com/sea/creativecloud.html) first, and after installing it - that's where you find these apps.



### **Sketch App Plugins & Tools**

**Abstract**  
Its version control for Sketch

```text
brew cask install abstract
```

{% hint style="info" %}
I work mostly with Figma - and it has version control baked in already.
{% endhint %}

**Zeplin**  
Design to developer handoff

```text
brew cask install zeplin
```

{% hint style="info" %}
My favourite developer handoff tool that integrates nicely with Slack. A bit redundant if you use the Invision + Sketch combo. And very redundant if you're using Figma.
{% endhint %}

**Craft**  
Excellent plugin for Sketch from Invision

```text

```

### **Icon Managers**

**Iconjar** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)  
An icon Manager

```text
brew cask install iconjar
brew cask install nucleo
```

**Nucleo**  
An icon Manager

```text
brew cask install iconjar
brew cask install nucleo
```

{% hint style="info" %}
I used to be a fan of using icon fonts for design & development because of the ease of use. However, I realized loading a font file is a another http request and might be render-blocking \(if you happen to have it on the top fold of the page\) Since the dawn of svg, its actually much more lighter
{% endhint %}

### 

### **Webfont Generator**

**Fontplop**  
A ****Fast, Simple, & Free Open Source Webfont Converter

```text
brew cask install fontplop
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Converting OTF / TTF font files to @font-face used to be a drag and drop thing I usually do at FontSquirrel and other online webfont generators. But having a drag-n-drop native app like this really speeds up my workflow. Previously I used [FontPrep](https://github.com/briangonzalez/fontprep) but was discontinued.

### Image Optimizers

**ImageOptim**  
Image compression tools

```text
brew cask install imageoptim
```

**Optimage** [üèÜ](https://emojipedia.org/trophy/)

Image compression tools

```text
brew cask install optimage
```

{% hint style="info" %}
Optimizing images should be already baked in your frontend tooling \(by running image optimizing npm packages using gulp, react, grunt, ect.\) But just incase you need to do it manually, here are some good ones. ImageOptim is free, but the paid alternative Optimage [might be better](https://optimage.app/benchmark). But with most frontend tooling utilizing image compression already - you decide.
{% endhint %}

Each of these prototyping tools has their own set of pros and cons. Find and use each one that fits according to the needs and requirements of your project.

**Principle**

brew cask install principle

```text
brew cask install flinto
```

**Framer**
