# Apps

As much as possible, I do try to install everything using Homebrew because I find updating and managing these apps faster on the terminal.

```text
$ brew cask install <app-name>
```

However, not everything is available on the caskroom, such as Adobe CC, so there will be a few exceptions :\)
