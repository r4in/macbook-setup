# Terminals

I've recently been trying out **Hyper + Pure** setup instead of my usual **iTerm** setup. Mainly because of the less customizations I need to do and I like how it looks.

Setting up my usual iTerm theming feels like a pain. If you want a minimalist, easy-to-setup and working terminal â€“ I recommend trying out the Hyper + Pure setup. If you have the time and enjoy tinkering, check out the iTerm Setup.
