# Terminal Setups

Throughout the years, I've moved between different terminals. My favorite one currently is **Warp.** Mainly because of the fewer customizations I need to do and how clean it looks straight out of the box. Not much of a headache to get started and running too.

It seemed like setting up my usual iTerm theming felt like a chore. If you want a minimalist, easy-to-setup, and working terminal – I recommend trying out the **Warp setup**. **Hyper** isn't bad too. If you have the time, hate web-wrappers, and enjoy tinkering – check out the **iTerm Setup**.

### Terminologies

**Console:** This is the system as a whole. This is both the command line as well as the output from previous commands.

**Command Line:** This is the actual line in a console where you type your command.

**Prompt:** This is the beginning of the command line. It usually provides some contextual information like who you are, where you are, and other useful info. It typically ends in a **$**. After the prompt, you will be typing commands.

**Terminal:** This is the actual interface to the console. The program we use to interact with the console is actually a “terminal emulator”, providing us the experience of typing into an old-school terminal from the convenience of our modern graphical operating system.

**Text CLI shells:** Basically is a user interface for accessing OS services. Examples are Bourne-Again Shell (Bash), z Shell (zsh) Korn shell (ksh). macOS ships with [a couple of shells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison\_of\_command\_shells) actually, you can check them out by running  `cat /etc/shells`
