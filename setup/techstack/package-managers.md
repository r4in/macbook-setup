### npm & nodejs

npm makes it easy for JavaScript developers to share and reuse code, and makes it easy to update the code that youâ€™re sharing, so you can build amazing things.

npm is distributed with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)- which means that when you download Node.js, you automatically get npm installed on your computer.
