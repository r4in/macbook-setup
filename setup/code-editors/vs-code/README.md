# Visual Studio Code

_Visual Studio Code_ combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

I'm using VS Code as my daily driver, so here's how I set it up!

## To install:

[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) the **.dmg** file and drag-and-drop it to the **Applications** folder or simply

```text
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```
