# VS Code

_Visual Studio Code_ combines the simplicity of a source code editor with powerful developer tooling, like IntelliSense code completion and debugging.

I've recently switched over to VSCode, so I'll be sharing my setup.

## To install:

[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) the **.dmg** file and drag-and-drop it to the **Applications** folder or simply

```text
brew cask install visual-studio-code
```
