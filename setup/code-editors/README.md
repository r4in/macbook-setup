# Code Editor Setups

A decade ago, I had my fair share of using **Notepad++, Brackets & Atom** as my default code editor. Until **SublimeText** came and changed everything with lightning fast speed.

Couple of years later, **Visual Studio Code** came out of nowhere and tho initially bulky, it's performance has improved for the past 4 years and I find it more powerful too. It has a huge plugin community and is truly extensible. VS Code as been my daily driver since 2016 and I highly recommend it for designers trying to code.
