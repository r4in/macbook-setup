# Packages

{% hint style="info" %}
Package Control is already built-in by default. \(It used to be a separate package to install\) So no need to install it manually anymore üëç
{% endhint %}

You can simple go to package control and search for themes. I would recommend using the [Material theme](https://github.com/equinusocio/material-theme) or [Brogrammer Theme](https://github.com/kenwheeler/brogrammer-theme).
