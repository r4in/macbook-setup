# System Preferences

The first thing you should do is update your OS. To do that, go to: **Apple menu () -> System Settings.. -> Software Update**

Don't forget to sign in your Apple ID to sync in your iCloud account

There are a couple of tweaks you could make to the System Preferences. These settings below are all optional, so consider them as suggestions.

### General

* Check **Allow Handoff between this Mac and your iCloud devices**
* Recent Items : **None**

### Appearance

* Appearance : **Dark**

### Accessibility

* **Motor**
  * **Pointer Control**
    * Check **Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present** (I primarily use a mouse. So I find it annoying when I accidentally move the mouse pointer when typing on the keyboard.)

### Control Center

* **Spotlight** -> Set to **Don't Show in Menu Bar**

### Desktop & Dock

Your dock is probably flooded with all of macOS' default apps. I usually drag them all to the trash to make it cleaner. Then I would usually hide the Dock (`cmd + option + d`) because accessing apps through spotlight search is faster.&#x20;

*   **Dock**

    * Size : **Small**
    * Position on screen : **Left**
    * Uncheck **Show suggested and recent apps in Dock**


* **Desktop & Stage Manager**
  * Set **Click wallpaper to reveal desktop -> Only in Stage Manager**

### Wallpaper

* Update your favorite wallpaper.

### Siri & Spotlight

* Uncheck **Ask Siri**

### Users & Groups

* Set up your Password, Apple ID, Avatar, etc.

### Internet Accounts

* Add your Google, Yahoo, or iCloud accounts to sync in with the Mail, Calendar, Messages, and other macOS apps.

### Keyboard

* Set  **Press** 🌐︎ **key  to** -> **Do Nothing**
* Set **Shortcuts** -> **Spotlight** -> uncheck **Show Spotlight search**&#x20;
* Set **Shortcuts** -> **Spotlight** -> uncheck **Show Finder search window**

{% hint style="info" %}
Fun fact: **Spotlight** was redesigned completely on [OS X 10.10 Yosemite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS\_X\_Yosemite) and resembles a lot to **Alfred.** I still prefer using **Ueli** over Spotlight for various reasons (Just do your research). That being said, we'll be disabling the Spotlight search keyboard shortcut since we'll be using Ueli anyway.
{% endhint %}

### Mouse

If you're using a Magic Mouse:

* Adjust tracking speed to preferred speed
* Set **Secondary click** -> **Click Right Side**

### Trackpad

* **Point & Click**
  * Enable **Tap to click**
