# System Preferences

The first thing you should do is update your OS. To do that, go to: **Apple menu () -> System Settings… -> Software Update**.

Don’t forget to sign in with your Apple ID to sync your iCloud account.

There are a couple of tweaks you can make to the System Preferences. The settings below are all optional, so consider them as suggestions.

### General

* **Airdrop & Handoff**
  * **Airdrop** -> Select **Everyone**

### Appearance

* Appearance : **Dark**

### Accessibility

* **Motor**
  * **Pointer Control**
    * **Check** _Ignore built-in trackpad when mouse or wireless trackpad is present_\
      I primarily use a mouse, so I find it annoying when I accidentally move the mouse pointer while typing on the keyboard.

### Control Center

* **Menu Bar Only**
  * **Spotlight** -> Set to **Don't Show in Menu Bar**

### Siri & Spotlight

* Uncheck **Ask Siri**

### Desktop & Dock

Your dock is probably flooded with all of macOS’s default apps. I usually drag them all to the Trash to make it cleaner. Then, I typically hide the Dock (`cmd + option + d`) because launching apps an app launcher like Raycast is way better.

*   **Dock**

    * Size : **Small**
    * Position on screen : **Left**
    * Uncheck **Automatically hide and show the Dock**
    * Uncheck **Show suggested and recent apps in Dock**


*   **Desktop & Stage Manager**

    * Uncheck **Show Items -> On Desktop**
    * Set **Click wallpaper to reveal desktop -> Only in Stage Manager**
    * Uncheck **Stage Manager**


* **Hot Corners**
  * Set all to none

### Wallpaper

* Update your favorite wallpaper.

### Internet Accounts

* Add your Google, Yahoo, or iCloud accounts to sync with the Mail, Calendar, Messages, and other macOS apps.

### Keyboard

* Set  **Press** 🌐︎ **key  to** -> **Do Nothing**
* **Keyboard Shortcuts**
  * **Spotlight** -> uncheck **Show Spotlight search**&#x20;
  * **Spotlight** -> uncheck **Show Finder search window**

{% hint style="info" %}
**Fun fact:** Spotlight was completely redesigned in OS X 10.10 Yosemite and now resembles Alfred. However, I still prefer using Raycast over Spotlight for various reasons. That being said, we’ll be disabling the Spotlight search keyboard shortcut since we’ll be using Raycast anyway.
{% endhint %}

### Mouse

If you're using a Magic Mouse:

* Adjust tracking speed to preferred speed
* Set **Secondary click** -> **Click Right Side**

### Trackpad

* **Point & Click**
  * Enable **Tap to click**
