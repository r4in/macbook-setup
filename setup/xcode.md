# Xcode

[Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) is an integrated development environment for macOS containing a suite of software development tools developed by Apple for developing software for macOS, iOS, watchOS and tvOS.

Download and install it from the App Store or from [Apple's website](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

For installing Xcode command line tools run the following command in your terminal:

```text
xcode-select --install
```

It'll prompt you to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions and you'll have Xcode and Xcode command line tools both installed.
